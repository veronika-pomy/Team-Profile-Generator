## Description

This application generates a website with basic team information to be easily accessed by a manager. 

The command-line application prompts users to fill in their details, followed by details of the team members. It generates a clean and formatted HTML page.

CLI app:

- The application starts with prompts asking to input team manager information: name, employee ID, email, and office number
- Then it presents a menu with the choices to "add an engineer," "add an intern," or "finish building the team."
- When an engineer is chosen, the app prompts questions for the following information: name, employee ID, email, and GitHub profile
- When an intern is chosen, the app prompts questions for the following information: name, employee ID, email, and school name
- After each team member is added, the app presents the choices menu again
- When the "finish building the team" choice is selected, the application exits, and the HTML file is generated 

Webpage functionality: 

- Clean and polished UI
- When a team member's email is clicked, the default email program opens and populates the TO: field with the email address
- When a team member's GitHub name is clicked, the GitHub profile opens in a new tab
